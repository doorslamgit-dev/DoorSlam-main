# GCSE Mathematics — Quadratic Equations

## Learning Objectives

- Solve quadratic equations by factorisation
- Use the quadratic formula
- Complete the square

## Key Formula

The quadratic formula for solving ax² + bx + c = 0:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

## Example

Solve: x² + 5x + 6 = 0

**By factorisation**:
(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
x = -2 or x = -3

**By formula**:
a = 1, b = 5, c = 6
x = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2
x = (-5 ± 1) / 2
x = -2 or x = -3

## Practice Questions

1. Solve x² - 7x + 12 = 0
2. Solve 2x² + 3x - 5 = 0
3. Solve x² - 4 = 0
