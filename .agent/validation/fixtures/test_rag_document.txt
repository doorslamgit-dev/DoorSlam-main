The Eiffel Tower: A Comprehensive Study Guide

The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.

Construction Facts:
- Height: 330 metres (1,083 ft) including antenna
- Weight: approximately 7,300 tonnes of iron
- Built using 2.5 million rivets
- Construction took 2 years, 2 months and 5 days
- Originally intended to stand for 20 years

The tower was built as the centrepiece of the 1889 World's Fair, held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. It was the world's tallest man-made structure until the Chrysler Building in New York was completed in 1930.

Engineering Significance:
The Eiffel Tower demonstrates key engineering principles including load distribution, wind resistance, and structural efficiency. The tower's design uses a mathematical curve to distribute wind forces evenly throughout the structure.
